Child Mortality Prediction Dashboard
Welcome to the Child Mortality Prediction Dashboard, a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting child mortality rates, specifically the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and the Under-Five Mortality Rate (U5MR). This project leverages machine learning models trained on health and demographic data to provide actionable insights for improving child health outcomes.

Project Overview
This web-based application allows users to:

Predict IMR and U5MR by inputting demographic and health-related data.
View personalized prediction results after logging in or signing up.
The tool is designed to help healthcare providers and policymakers make data-driven decisions by identifying risk factors and prioritizing interventions.

Access the Dashboard
The application is hosted and accessible online at the following URL:

If you are a new user:
Click on the Sign-Up button to create an account.
Fill in your details and register.
If you already have an account:
Enter your credentials to log in.
Note: You must be logged in to view prediction results.

Step 2: Make Predictions
Scroll to the bottom of the dashboard to find the prediction form.
Fill in the required fields with the relevant data for your prediction:
For IMR predictions, click the IMR Predict button after entering the data.
For U5MR predictions, click the U5MR Predict button after entering the data.
Step 3: View Results
Once logged in, your predictions will be processed, and the results will be displayed on the dashboard.
Features
User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login functionality to protect user data and ensure personalized results.
Machine Learning Models: Advanced algorithms power the IMR and U5MR predictions, providing reliable and actionable insights.
Simple and Intuitive Interface: Easy-to-use forms for data input and straightforward access to results.
Future Enhancements
Development of a mobile app for real-time access to predictions.
Integration of additional health metrics, such as maternal nutrition and immunization coverage.
Broader application to other regions or countries facing similar child health challenges.
I hope this tool serves as a valuable resource for improving child health outcomes. Your feedback is highly appreciated and will help us refine and expand this project.

Enjoy using the Child Mortality Prediction Dashboard!
