Child Mortality Prediction Dashboard
Welcome to the Child Mortality Prediction Dashboard, a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting child mortality rates, specifically the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and the Under-Five Mortality Rate (U5MR). This project leverages machine learning models trained on health and demographic data to provide actionable insights for improving child health outcomes.

📌 Project Overview
This web-based application allows users to:

✅ Predict IMR and U5MR by inputting demographic and health-related data.
✅ View personalized prediction results after logging in or signing up.
✅ Support healthcare providers and policymakers in making data-driven decisions by identifying risk factors and prioritizing interventions.

🚀 Access the Dashboard

🔥 Features
✔️ User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login functionality.
✔️ Machine Learning Models: Advanced algorithms provide IMR and U5MR predictions.
✔️ Simple & Intuitive Interface: Easy-to-use forms for input and straightforward access to results.

🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Development of a mobile app for real-time access to predictions.
🔹 Integration of additional health metrics like maternal nutrition & immunization coverage.
🔹 Expanding the tool to other regions or countries facing similar child health challenges.

I hope this tool serves as a valuable resource for improving child health outcomes.
📩 Your feedback is highly appreciated and will help refine and expand this project!
